## What it is
This application is intended for those who professionally upfit emergency vehicles. This application gives you the ability to keep track of employees, customers, and projects.
Projects have various labels available to make it easier to monitor the priority of the project.

## Why it came about
I've spent the last decade plus in the upfitting industry and it has always baffled me the lack of organization many shops have when it comes to keeping track of what's important, your employees and your customers.
Having the ability to have all your employees and customers in one location helps efficiency and having them associated with work coming into the shop helps with scheduling and employee productivity. 

## Functionality
Each of the entities (Employee, Customer, Project) has the ability to create, edit, view, and delete. When employees and customers are added to the database, they will automatically appear in drop down menus when you go to
create a project, so they will need to be created before a project can be created.

## More to come
While this is the initial deployment of the application, there will be plenty more to come! So please pay attention to this section, I will list feature updates here.
